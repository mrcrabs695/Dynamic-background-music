# Dynamic Background Music

This is a small python script made using the Qt framework and pynput to imitate the opera gx dynamic music. (albeit in a really janky and somewhat glitchy way)

Once started you can press "\<ctrl\> + \<alt\> + \<pause\>" to stop it

## NOTE
Right now it just operates in the command line, but it will have a small gui to change the volume and start/stop the music.
